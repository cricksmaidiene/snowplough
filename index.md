## About üì∞

Our study introduces an approach to analyze news content, centering on the development of a topic classifier using the extensive `All The News v2` dataset. Our methodology progresses from baseline classifiers to more advanced models, culminating in a fine-tuned BERT classifier, adept at categorizing news articles into distinct topics such as 'Sports,' 'Finance', etc., based on textual features and news metadata.

This classifier is augmented with sentiment analysis and other indicators for a supplemental exploration into media bias, aiming to delineate its various manifestations. The core of our research lies in the robust topic classification, with media bias analysis providing additional insights.
We‚Äôve made the code, notebooks, models and newly generated (topic classified) dataset publicly available. The newly created dataset is listed as All The News v2.1 on Kaggle and a fine-tuned BERT classifier for the same is also made available online.

## Data üìá

### AllTheNews

AllTheNews is a popular dataset of news articles that has two versions. Version 1 & 2.

* [Version 2.0](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset) has 2.7 million articles from a number of sources.
* It is a published dataset that is readily downloadable.
* The date range of articles is from January 1, 2016 to April 2, 2020.
* The only metadata available is the article `title`, `publication`, `section`, `author`, `date`, and `content`. We use a subset of these as labels for our classifiers.
